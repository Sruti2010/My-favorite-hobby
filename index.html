    <p>My favorite hobby is soccer. I have been playing it since I was 6 years old, and have loved it since. After a long day of hard work at school, it feels refreshing to go to soccer practice and have some fun. Being on a competitive team, people might think that competitive soccer is just running and scrimaging,but it is so much more! </p>

        <p> My position is right midfielder. It is my job to score/help the forward score. I am meant to smoothly transition the ball from the back of the field to the front. The right midfielder is in the middle of the field but on the right side. For soccer, we call this a seven. </p>

    There are 2 types of soccer: there is competitive, and non-competitive. I happen to be in competitive. For competitive soccer, You play games, and you can win medals. For example, I played in a competitive soccer tournament in fall of 2019. There, my team acheived 3rd place, awarding us a bronze medal.
